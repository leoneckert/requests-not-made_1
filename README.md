# requests-not-made_1

## why this is up on my github
this code does work well, but doesn't achieve what I intend yet. I uploaded it anyway because right now I am really excited about c++ and this is the very first thing I ever did in c++. It's probably not very well written, but gave me much joy. 

## the project
I am using the libtins library to build an alaysis tool of HTTP requests. Specifically the share of the HTTP request that go to stuff we did not ask for (e.g. trackers, analysis etc.). Hopefully soon more in another script.
